# Corewar
This project implements a compiler that tranforms pseudo-asm code into byte-code, which is then interpreted by a virtual machine.
Build this project with `make`, then you will get two executables asm (compiler) and corewar (virtual machine). You can build asm and corewar independently with `make asm` and `make corewar`.

Corewar is a programming game in which two or more programs run in a simulated computer (the VM) with the goal of terminating every other program and surviving as long as possible.

## ./asm

## ./corewar
